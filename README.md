## 🔭 Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

- [ ] **[the ability for users to customize the greeting message. ]**
- For example, users could enter their own name or message to be displayed instead of the default "Hello, World!" message. This could be done through a simple text input field or through more advanced customization options such as font style, color, or animation effects. This feature could make the project more engaging and personalized for users, allowing them to feel more connected to the application.

- [ ] **[Voice Recognition]**
- With voice recognition, users could simply say "Hello" or their name out loud and the application would respond with a personalized greeting message. This feature
  could be useful for users with disabilities or those who prefer hands-free interactions with technology.
- [ ] **[Social Media Integration: ]**
- Social media integration would allow users to share their personalized greeting message on their social media profiles. This could be done by adding a "Share" button   that generates a link or image of the greeting message, which users could then post on their social media profiles for their friends and followers to see.
